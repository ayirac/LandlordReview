Dear Dr. Li,

I hope you're having a nice summer. I was curious about the potential independent research opporutunity focusing on vulnerable systems implementing token authentication for this fall semester. The GhostToken
exploit was the result of a developer oversight in which applications tied to google cloud projects that are in a delete state are hidden from the user view resulting in malicious apps being able to become invisible at will.
I also read about a recent attack against US Department of Defense email inboxes in which attackers were able to attain access by using a stolen consumer key that shouldn't of been usable for signing forged tokens.
Ultimately, this was the result of a 'validation error in Microsoft code'. A lot of these exploits seem to be tied to the fact that the systems weren't fully tested and the developers who implemented the
initial code weren't aware of the potential vulnerabilities that they were creating. Also, both of these exploits require some sort of previous exploit/social engineering to get a user to validate an application or an consumer
signing key so they might not be tested as rigirously compared to exploits that have no pre-requisite. It would be interesting to do an indepth study on common products that might have some overlooked issues, like an Amazon echo or similar IoT device.
